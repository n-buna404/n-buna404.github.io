Altruism hmm. Shinichi tried to prove that he was still human by standing up against hooligans. Humans value something more than their own survival. I liked how Migi inserted the line " They are more animal than animal". <br><br>
Motherly instinct. I think that it was not limited to human beings but a trait commonly shared among the living species<br><br>
The most excruating pain always come from the demise of you loved ones, not you own.<br><br>
The sun also rises. I thought of a song by FaLiLV. Upon googling, maybe both are making reference towards Hermingway 's novel. <br><br>
The badass jump over the barrier was well animated along with the upbeat OST. What a sakuga.Thank you Madhouse!
