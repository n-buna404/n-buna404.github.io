Value of live. These two episodes made me thought of cutting down unnecessary consumption of junk food and consume food moderately so that just essential nutrients can be acquired for survival. Some would argue that you should go vegan but are't plants living? In the end, everyone value their own live and interest than others, well there will always some case that shows otherwise. Human are not that monotone yet.<hr>
Migi said that human is the species that resemble demon the most. There is no denying of that. We consume, kill or hurt almost every species on Earth for our own interest. Parasytes are parasytes to us, but we are parasytes to Earth?<hr>
Watching this really make me doubts that it there is true way of life(正しい人生). Life is not simply black and white as despicted to the child but rather a splat of grey with the infusion of black and white. Being empathic of others is a virtue deemed by the society but how many people or lives u can take into account for? Well, being in a pinch does not justify doing nothing. <hr>
Just dabble and find ur answer to life. This is the best I can come up with. Maybe Hitoshi Iwaaki can come up with something interesting to all the questions he tossed to the audiences.
