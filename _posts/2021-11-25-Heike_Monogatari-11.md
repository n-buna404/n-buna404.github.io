The Buddha's temple bells toll the message<br>
that all existence is impermanent.<br>
The sal tree's blossoms turn white to grieve him:<br>
a reminder that all who flourish must fall.<br>
Indulgence does not last.<br>
It shall but be like a spring night's dream.<br>
The dauntless shall meet their end.<br>
They shall be as mere dust before the wind.<br>
