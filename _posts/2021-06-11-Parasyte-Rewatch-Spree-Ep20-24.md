Hirokawa had always been human. <br><br>
When you feel your life is on the line, your true nature surfaces.<br><br>
Ep22-静と醒 was well done you just had to feel it yourself. Wait I just realised we had three Sei to Sei.<br><br>
I am fading...<br>
I feel oddly sleepy,<br>
yet it all eclipsed by the feelinng that I am so alone.<br>
So this is death..<br><br>
Don't you have someone in your life you care about?<br>
Even if they are a stranger, once i come to know them, I can't just abandon them.<br>
That is what it means to be human<br>
But you...<br>
I don't know how much time you have left, but give some thought to as many things and as many ideas as you can come up with.<br>
If you throw everything away, that is the end.<br>
Don't give up, no matter what and be flexible.<br><br>
"Earth is not living." <br>
Migi's counterargument to Hirokawa.<br><br>
"I think it's human arrogance to think we understand how other life forms feel.<br>
What drives us is simply self-gratification.<br>
So in the end, it's hypocritical for us to love Earth without loving ourselves."<br>
Shinichi's counterargument to Hirokawa.<br><br>
Quotes from reddit<br><br>
"I think Migi just recessed back into the subconscious of Shinichi's mind so that he can sit and think about everything for awhile. Maybe try to figure out what's going on and just process everything.<br>
I think that's exactly what Murano thought in the end, though. He wasn't one of the monsters because he behaved like a human, he had ethics and a conscience.<br>
Think of it like this, we have in the end of the series a face off between a full blooded human who is in every sense a monster, and a human who has an actual monster living inside of him who has more compassion and human traits than the actually untainted human holding a knife to Murano.<br>
I think that speaks well for how she felt. He doesn't need to be a human, he just needs to act like one. It's not who you are that defines you, but your actions and choices"<br><br>
"Humans don't have an exclusive right to being humane. Some of us are just downright monsters. And maybe all the Parasytes aren't bad, they're just trying to survive like the rest of us."<br>
