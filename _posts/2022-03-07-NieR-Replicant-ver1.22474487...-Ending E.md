At first, I was intrigued to play NieR Automata after heard after the announcement of anime project. It was a game that kinda like cool but I never tried it for some reason. There are some comments from the announcement which was like what about anime for Part 1. Then I was like 'Never heard of the part one.' All knowing Google bestowed me upon the knowledge NieR Replicant/Gestalt which was released in 2010 and had a version upgrade just in 2021. Guess I will start the series with this.<br><br>
After 60+ hours of playing (insert Song of the Ancients), I finally cleared Ending E. (Quest completion 98% cuz I said no the nett negative gold quest in Part 1.) Tbh I enjoyed Part 1 a lot more. Chillng around, doing quests and meeting new acquaintance was the best part of the story. Maybe Yoko should not make ppl grind through 4 times for all endings even with subtle change it would kinda exhaust you. Unless you played as another character coughing at ahem ahem Automata. When I got to play as Kaine in Ending E. Oh boy! You can't imagine how happy I was. I even duplicate the save files so that I can rerun with different costumes.<br><br>
Ending E is the adaption of same title short story from the 2010 Grimoir NieR. It was very well executed. A moment of silence for those that play until Ending A and thought they had finshed it.<br><br>
<B>Even if there is no future, I want to be with you.</B><br><br>
Tbh I think it is a happy ending from Yoko Taro. Death will claim every mortal, so it is best to spend time with your love ones. They need you. Something replicant NieR  was ignorant about.
I am so glad Nier got called out for this.<br>
<h1>"GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE, you rotten ******!"</h1><br>
Best scene haha.<br>
Let end this with the last weapon story of the 38 weapons in game. Play this song when u read them.<br>
Why this u asked? Well this is the closest one I can found to the game ost playing for the weapon story section (maybe due to my location and applied Change Music.<br>
To be honest, it fits perfectly with Ending E and the story of this weapon.<br>

<B>Kaineâ€™s Sword</B>
<pre>
A sword wielded by a woman that loved killing. There were originally two, but one broke in the midst of a fierce battle.

She fears.
She fears the pain. The suffering. The sadness of losing those she cherishes. However faint, that feeling alone remains with her.

She fights.
Her swordsmanship is so violent, it wards off sorrow itself. Nothing can stop her vengeful blade from its grim work, not even the fountains of blood that cloud her vision.

She dreams.
The darkness sings to her of solitude and despair, but she resists, time and again, never breaking.

She presses on.
Even if the future awaits has no meaning, she presses on.
Because this is the world with</pre><font color="#ffffff"> NieR.
