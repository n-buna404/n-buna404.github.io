TBH  I am quite surprised when I get to know that MEMAI SIREN wrote an absolute banger for Build Divide: Code Black.
Looking forward for their new album.

Project spinoid recently also released ep3. It is such a great time to be alive.

Lastly let me share one song from them that I had been looping recently.<br>
