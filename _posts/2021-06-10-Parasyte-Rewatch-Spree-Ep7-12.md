A dead dog isn't a dog anymore. It is a dog-shaped lump of meat.<br><br>
The power of fan girl. I am always observing you.<br><br>
Oh shot, blue bird 青い鳥。My PTSD is coming back. To be honest, I had always been team kana. If only she listened to what shinichi said. Another "I can't cry but I am dying inside" incoming.<br><br>
Unrequited love huh. That is more than enough itami（痛み）we need already. Btw miyuki sawahiro had a distinctive low pitch at every end of her line. For your info, she was voicing Sinon from GGO. <br><br>
Ep12-心　14:55 <br>
I will show you my power properly this time for sure.<br>
今度こそ、ちゃんと私の力見せた上げる。<br><br>
My power to sense you, and you alone.<br>
あなた一人を感じる力。<br><br>
No one else, not even that girl, Satomi has that special power.<br>
他の誰にも、里美てこにもできない、特別の力。<br><br>
So you feel me alone, too.<br>
だからあなたも私だけを感じて。<br><br>
新一加<br>

"Kana was not simply a stalker she was a dumb stalker and her death was her fault only. Even with her new special ability if she had only stayed more cautious and not go to dark, deserted, creepy places on her own(sic!) she would be just fine. Besides she wasn't even smart enough to learn from her own mistakes. Even in this episode she has mistaken Shinichi with some other parasite at least once, what the hell was she thinking just strolling after him later?<br>
I don't really understand all those comments describing her as "interesting" or "best". Her only motivation throughout the series was to date Shinichi and her absolute lack of reason was almost unbeliavable. The only thing I was able to think about when she got stabbed was JUST DIE ALREADY. And even if I am a bit harsh on her the sad truth is that if you don't think fast - you die fast."<br><br>
"ur like a parasyte, just looking into the facts and not empathy. Human thinking is irrational, meaning that our rational thoughts can get clouded by emotions. Kana had dreams, was actually in love with Shinichi and could sense him. It might have been her fault, but some/most people would assume it isn't a cooincidence and they're linked by the red thread of fate or something. So it's her fault, but it's not really HER fault but rather the human brain thinking irrationally."
